Scaling UI with Microfrontends

I am going to show you to scale front end development with Microfrontends using: 
1. HTTP server routing to redirect multiple apps, Gateway pattern (Ngix).
2. Using front-end loader Single-spa, Mooa.
3. iFrame. Use iFrame and custom messaging mechanisms.
4. Using Webcomponents.
5. Server-side composition. 

For each of the above we will show how to have separate code repositories, build pipelines, we will also use docker and AWS.
